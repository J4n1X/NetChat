You want to know why this code looks like crap? Well, I lost it and had to use dotpeek to decompile it. Well, tough luck, guess I'll clean up soon.


Progress so far:

Got the Connection to GitHub working, experiments are commencing

Got actual Workflows to build the Program now. Amazing.

Projects Client-Side and Server-Side created and Issue added.

New Branch created.
