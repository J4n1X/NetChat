# NetChat
This Program is an attempt at learning how to communicate over the Internet. The way I wish to accomplish this is to write a Messaging System with a Client-Server model.

The Program is currently barely usable, unstable and it will crash sometimes. If you encounter Issues, please create an Issue request, as I can sort out and fix the problem faster if I actually know about it.
Feel free to use all the files in This Repository however you want!
